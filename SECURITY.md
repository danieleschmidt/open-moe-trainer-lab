## Security Measures

### 🔒 Code Security

#### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Model inputs are checked for malicious content
- Configuration files are validated against schemas

#### Authentication & Authorization
- API endpoints require proper authentication
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Secure token management

#### Data Protection
- Model weights and training data are encrypted at rest
- Secure communication channels (TLS/HTTPS)
- No logging of sensitive information

### 🛡️ Infrastructure Security

#### Container Security
- Base images are regularly updated
- Security scanning with Trivy and Snyk
- Non-root user execution
- Resource limits and security contexts

#### Network Security
- Internal service communication encryption
- Network policies and firewalls
- VPN access for remote development

#### Secrets Management
- Environment variables for configuration
- External secret management systems
- No hardcoded credentials

### 🔍 Security Scanning

#### Automated Scanning
