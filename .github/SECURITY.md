# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to maintain safety for all users.

### 2. Report via GitHub Security Advisories

Go to our [Security Advisories](https://github.com/your-org/open-moe-trainer-lab/security/advisories) page and click "Report a vulnerability".

### 3. Alternative Reporting Methods

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available, email us at:
- **Primary**: security@your-org.com
- **Backup**: maintainers@your-org.com

### 4. Include the Following Information

```
**Vulnerability Type**: [e.g., Code Injection, Data Exposure, Authentication Bypass]
**Affected Component**: [e.g., Training Pipeline, API Endpoint, Docker Container]
**Severity Assessment**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Attack Vector**: [How the vulnerability can be exploited]
**Impact**: [What could happen if exploited]
**Reproduction Steps**: [Step-by-step instructions]
**Proof of Concept**: [Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue]
**Suggested Fix**: [If you have ideas for remediation]
**Reporter Information**: [Your name and contact information]
```

## Security Response Process

### Timeline
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed analysis and fix development (for critical issues)
- **14 days**: Security patch release (for high/critical issues)
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (after fix is released)

### Communication
- We will keep you informed throughout the process
- Credit will be given in our security advisory unless you prefer anonymity
- We may ask for additional details or clarification

## Security Measures

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with CodeQL and Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks for all dependencies
- **Secret Detection**: Automated scanning for accidentally committed secrets
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-aware code review

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Regular vulnerability scanning of Docker images
- **Supply Chain**: Verification of build artifacts and dependencies
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for all system access
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### ML-Specific Security
- **Model Security**: Protection against model poisoning and adversarial attacks
- **Data Privacy**: Safeguards for training and inference data
- **Compute Security**: Secure handling of GPU resources and distributed training
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, and input validation

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Development Environment
```bash
# Use official Docker images
docker pull your-org/moe-trainer:latest-security-scan

# Verify checksums
curl -L https://github.com/your-org/open-moe-trainer-lab/releases/download/v0.1.0/checksums.txt
```

### Model Training
```python
# Validate input data
from moe_lab.security import InputValidator

validator = InputValidator()
safe_data = validator.validate_dataset(your_dataset)

# Use secure checkpointing
trainer = MoETrainer(
    model=model,
    secure_checkpointing=True,
    checkpoint_encryption=True
)
```

### Production Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security settings
services:
  moe-api:
    image: your-org/moe-trainer:latest
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    user: "1000:1000"
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

### Configuration Security
```bash
# Set secure environment variables
export SECURE_MODEL_ENCRYPTION=true
export API_RATE_LIMIT=100
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Don't log sensitive data in debug mode
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Model Weights
- Model weights may contain sensitive information about training data
- Implement proper access controls for model storage
- Consider model encryption for sensitive applications

### Training Data
- Ensure training data doesn't contain sensitive information
- Implement data anonymization when necessary
- Use secure data loading mechanisms

### Distributed Training
- Secure communication channels between nodes
- Validate all distributed training participants
- Monitor for unusual network activity

### API Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Validate and sanitize all inputs

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management practices
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

## Security Tools and Integrations

### Automated Security Scanning
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Detect-secrets**: Secret detection in code

### Security Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Forward security logs to your SIEM system
- **Prometheus Alerting**: Security-focused alerting rules
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all operations

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture.
