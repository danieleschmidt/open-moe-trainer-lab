# Open MoE Trainer Lab - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

Open MoE Trainer Lab is an end-to-end toolkit for training, fine-tuning, and deploying Mixture of Experts (MoE) models with production-ready infrastructure and real-time analytics. This project addresses the critical gap in unified tooling for MoE model development, enabling researchers and engineers to efficiently work with sparse models that can achieve superior efficiency-to-performance ratios.

## Problem Statement

Current Mixture of Experts model training suffers from fragmented tooling:
- **Lack of Unified Framework**: Existing solutions are scattered across different repositories and frameworks
- **Limited Visualization**: No comprehensive tools for understanding router behavior and expert specialization
- **Complex Deployment**: Production inference optimization requires significant engineering effort
- **Poor Cost Visibility**: Unclear understanding of compute costs and efficiency gains

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core Training Infrastructure**: Support for Switch Transformer, Mixtral, and OLMoE architectures
- **Fine-tuning Capabilities**: LoRA and task-adaptive fine-tuning for MoE models
- **Router Analytics**: Real-time monitoring and visualization of expert routing decisions
- **Inference Optimization**: Selective expert loading, quantization, and caching strategies
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU and multi-node training with expert parallelism
- **Benchmarking Suite**: Comprehensive evaluation against standard tasks and baselines

### Out of Scope
- **Hardware Design**: Custom silicon or FPGA implementations
- **Non-Transformer Architectures**: CNNs, RNNs, or other non-transformer MoE variants
- **Cloud Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployment or cloud-specific tooling (separate project)
- **Model Serving at Scale**: Production-grade inference server (use TorchServe or similar)

## Success Criteria
