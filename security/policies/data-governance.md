# Data Governance Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the data governance policies for the Open MoE Trainer Lab project, ensuring responsible handling of training data, model weights, and sensitive information throughout the machine learning lifecycle.

## Data Classification

### üè∑Ô∏è Data Categories
