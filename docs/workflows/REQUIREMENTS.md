# Workflow Requirements Overview

## Manual Setup Required

**⚠️ GitHub Actions Permission Limitation**: Due to repository access restrictions, all workflow files must be created manually by repository maintainers.

## Essential Requirements

### 1. Repository Secrets
```yaml
# Required for Docker builds and deployments
DOCKER_USERNAME: your-registry-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD: your-registry-token
PYPI_TOKEN: your-pypi-publishing-token
```

### 2. Branch Protection Rules
- Enable branch protection on `main` branch
- Require status checks: `ci`, `security-scan`, `test-unit`
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions

### 3. Manual File Creation
```bash
# Copy workflow templates to .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 4. Required GitHub Actions Permissions
- Actions: Read/Write (for workflow execution)
- Contents: Write (for releases and commits)
- Security Events: Write (for security scanning)
- Pull Requests: Write (for status checks)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Templates**: Examine all files in `docs/workflows/examples/`
2. **Configure Secrets**: Add required secrets in repository settings  
3. **Copy Files**: Manually copy templates to `.github/workflows/`
4. **Test Workflows**: Create test PR to validate configuration
5. **Enable Protection**: Configure branch protection rules
