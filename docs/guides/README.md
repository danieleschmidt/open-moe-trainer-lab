## Guide Structure

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - What you'll learn and prerequisites
2. **Step-by-step Instructions** - Detailed walkthrough with code examples
3. **Best Practices** - Tips and recommendations
4. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
5. **Next Steps** - Related guides and advanced topics

## Conventions Used

### Code Examples
All code examples are tested and runnable. Look for these indicators:

```python
# ✅ Recommended approach
model = MoEModel(num_experts=8, experts_per_token=2)

# ❌ Not recommended
model = MoEModel(num_experts=128, experts_per_token=64)  # Too many active experts
```

### Difficulty Levels
- 🟢 **Beginner** - No prior MoE experience required
- 🟡 **Intermediate** - Basic understanding of deep learning and PyTorch
- 🔴 **Advanced** - Experience with distributed training and model optimization

### Time Estimates
Each guide includes estimated completion times:
- ⏱️ **Quick** (< 30 minutes)
- ⏱️⏱️ **Medium** (30 minutes - 2 hours)
- ⏱️⏱️⏱️ **Long** (2+ hours)
