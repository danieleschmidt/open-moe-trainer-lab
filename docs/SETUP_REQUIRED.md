# Manual Setup Required - UPDATED

## Overview
✅ **MAJOR UPDATE**: GitHub Actions workflows have been automatically deployed! Most automation is now active.

## ✅ COMPLETED AUTOMATICALLY
The following have been implemented and are ready to use:

### 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflows (DEPLOYED)
- **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) - Comprehensive testing and quality checks
- **Security Scanning** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) - Multi-layer security analysis  
- **Release Automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) - Automated releases and publishing

### 🔄 Dependency Management (ACTIVE)
- **Renovate** (`renovate.json`) - Advanced dependency automation with intelligent grouping
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) - GitHub native dependency updates

### 🛡️ Security Infrastructure (OPERATIONAL)
- **Secrets Baseline** (`.secrets.baseline`) - Secret detection configuration
- **Security Policy** (`.github/SECURITY.md`) - Comprehensive security guidelines
- **Automated Scanning** - CodeQL, Bandit, Trivy, and more

## 📋 REMAINING MANUAL ACTIONS (Reduced List)

### 1. GitHub Repository Settings
Navigate to Settings → General:
- ✅ **Actions**: Enable GitHub Actions (should be enabled by default)
- ✅ **Security**: Enable vulnerability alerts and Dependabot alerts
- ✅ **Pages**: Configure for documentation deployment (optional)

### 2. Branch Protection Rules  
Navigate to Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`:
```
✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   └── Select: CI Pipeline / quality-gate
   └── Select: Security Scanning / compliance-check
✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
✅ Include administrators
✅ Allow force pushes (false)
✅ Allow deletions (false)
```

### 3. Repository Secrets (For Release Workflow)
Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
```bash
Required Secrets:
- PYPI_API_TOKEN          # For PyPI publishing  
- TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN     # For test PyPI publishing

Optional Secrets:
- SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN       # For enhanced security scanning
- DOCKER_USERNAME         # If using external Docker registry
- DOCKER_PASSWORD         # If using external Docker registry
```

### 4. Enable Security Features
Navigate to Settings → Security & analysis:
```
✅ Dependency graph
✅ Dependabot alerts  
✅ Dependabot security updates
✅ Secret scanning
✅ Push protection for secrets
✅ Code scanning (will be enabled by workflows)
```

## 🧪 VERIFICATION STEPS

### 1. Test Automated Workflows
```bash
# Create a test branch and PR to verify:
git checkout -b test-automation
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md && git commit -m "test: verify automation"
git push origin test-automation
# Create PR via GitHub UI - workflows should run automatically
```

### 2. Verify Dependency Automation
- Check for automated PRs from Renovate/Dependabot within 24-48 hours
- Review dependency dashboard for pending updates

### 3. Test Security Scanning
```bash
# Push code changes to trigger security scans
# Check Actions tab for security scan results
# Verify no secrets are detected in commits
```

### 4. Validate Release Process
```bash
# Test release workflow (manual trigger):
# Go to Actions → Release → Run workflow
# Select version (e.g., v0.1.1) and create test release
```
